# RealMultiLLM - Feature Hierarchy

## Tier 1: Core Engine (The "Multi-LLM" Brain)
- **1.1: Model Abstraction Layer:** A unified interface to communicate with different types of LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Llama.cpp, etc.) regardless of their underlying API.
- **1.2: State Management:** Track the state of each LLM, conversation history, and context windows.
- **1.3: Concurrency Manager:** A robust system to handle parallel requests to multiple LLMs without blocking the UI or other processes. Leverages native `asyncio` (Python) or `Promise.all` (TypeScript).
- **1.4: Configuration Service:** Securely load, manage, and store API keys, model settings, and user preferences from a local configuration file (e.g., `config.toml`).

## Tier 2: User Interface & Experience (The "Real" Interaction)
- **2.1: Command-Line Interface (CLI):** A powerful CLI for initial testing and power-user workflows.
- **2.2: Graphical User Interface (GUI):** A native-feeling desktop application (built with a framework like Tauri or a Python GUI library) that provides an intuitive way to manage models and conversations.
- **2.3: Real-time Streaming:** Display LLM responses token-by-token for a responsive user experience.
- **2.4: Session Management:** Allow users to save, load, and manage different conversation sessions.

## Tier 3: Monetization & Distribution (The "Business" Layer)
- **3.1: Licensing System:** A mechanism to activate and validate user licenses. This must work offline after an initial check.
- **3.2: Update Notifier:** A non-intrusive way to inform users about new versions and guide them through the update process.
- **3.3: Packaged Application:** A distributable `.app` bundle for macOS, signed and notarized for security.

## Tier 4: Quality & Maintenance (The "Professional" Polish)
- **4.1: Comprehensive Logging:** Structured logging to help with debugging user-reported issues.
- **4.2: Automated Testing:** A full suite of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- **4.3: CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated linting, testing, and building on every push to the repository.
