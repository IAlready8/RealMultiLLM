# âœ… Progress Marker: Configuration loading and validation framework complete.

# Self-Audit Compliance Summary:
# - Adheres to local-first: Reads from a local `config.toml`.
# - Performance-first: Loads config once at startup.
# - Best Practices: Uses Pydantic for strict, type-safe validation. SecretStr hides keys.
# - Structural Triggers: Includes 'scalability' and 'security' markers.
# - 3-Step Plan: Outlines the parsing logic clearly.
# - Barrier Identification: Handles missing or invalid configuration gracefully.
