# Project Status Update (August 28, 2025)

## Phase 1: Unification & Cleanup - COMPLETE ✅

### Actions Taken:
1. Consolidated project structure by moving all files from `/Multi-LLM-Platform` to the root directory
2. Removed redundant directories (`/app.backup`, `/components.backup`, etc.)
3. Deleted the `/Multi-LLM-Platform` directory
4. Updated the `QWEN.md` file with the new project structure information

### Current Status:
- ✅ Project structure is now clean and unified with a single source of truth
- ✅ Build process is successful (`npm run build` completed without errors)
- ✅ Development server is running (`npm run dev` started successfully)
- ✅ Database is configured and working with SQLite for local development
- ⚠️ Some tests are failing (28 out of 78 tests) - primarily in API mocks and component tests

### Key Findings:
- The application has a comprehensive implementation of LLM integrations for OpenAI, Claude, Google AI, Llama, GitHub Copilot, and Grok
- Authentication is fully implemented with NextAuth.js
- Database schema is set up with Prisma for SQLite (switched from PostgreSQL for easier local development)
- Analytics tracking is implemented with Prisma storage
- Persona management system is complete with CRUD operations
- Conversation storage uses IndexedDB
- API key management with encryption is implemented
- Export/import functionality is available

## Phase 2: Backend LLM Service Implementation - IN PROGRESS ⏳

### Actions Taken:
1. Created a `.env.local` file with required environment variables for local development
2. Modified Prisma schema to use SQLite for easier local development
3. Generated Prisma client and created database migrations
4. Restarted development server with updated configuration
5. Ran tests to identify remaining issues

### Current Status:
- ✅ Development server is running and accessible at http://localhost:3000
- ✅ Database is properly configured and working with SQLite
- ⚠️ Test failures need to be addressed:
  - API mock issues in persona service tests
  - Component test issues with API key form
  - Hook test issues with conversation management
  - Service test issues with API client functions

### Next Steps:
1. Address failing tests to improve code quality and reliability
2. Verify core functionality in the browser:
   - Authentication flow
   - Database connectivity
   - LLM integrations with real API keys
3. Implement analytics service enhancements
4. Verify pipeline feature implementation
5. Test all LLM providers with real API keys

The consolidation phase has been successfully completed, establishing a solid foundation for the next phases of implementation. The project is now in a much more maintainable state with a clean, unified structure.
