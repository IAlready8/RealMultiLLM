# Experimental Advanced Feature Modules

These modules originated from the `copilot/fix-2cf9fcf8-*` branch and provide
building blocks for future enterprise capabilities. They are intentionally not
wired into runtime flows yet, but live under `lib/experimental/` for teams that
want to explore or extend them.

## Available Modules

- `performance-optimizer.ts` – adaptive tuning loops that learn from usage
  metrics, error rates, and latency to suggest configuration changes.
- `plugin-manager.ts` – hot-swappable plugin architecture with manifest
  validation, sandboxing hooks, and permission gates.
- `security-manager.ts` – policy definitions for runtime hardening, anomaly
  detection, and threat modelling helpers.
- `semantic-cache.ts` – vector-aware cache strategy for large language model
  responses with decay, eviction, and relevance scoring.
- `workflow-engine.ts` – declarative workflow runner that composes prompts,
  tools, and guardrails into orchestrated automation pipelines.

Each file exports self-contained TypeScript utilities with rich documentation
so they can be evaluated and adopted incrementally. Integrate them as needed by
importing from `@/lib/experimental/...`.
