# CI/CD System Documentation

## 🎯 Overview

This repository now has **IRON-CLAD** testing enforcement at multiple levels:

1. **Pre-commit hooks** (Local - runs on `git commit`)
2. **Pre-push hooks** (Local - runs on `git push`)
3. **GitHub Actions CI** (Remote - runs on push/PR)
4. **Strict CI workflow** (Remote - comprehensive validation)

## 📋 What Gets Checked

### Every Commit (Pre-commit Hook)
- ✅ TypeScript type checking
- ✅ ESLint (code quality)
- ⚡ Fast feedback (~30 seconds)

### Every Push (Pre-push Hook)  
- ✅ TypeScript type checking
- ✅ ESLint with NO warnings allowed
- ✅ **ALL unit tests**
- ✅ Production build verification
- ⏱️ Comprehensive validation (~2-3 minutes)

### Every GitHub Push/PR (CI)
- ✅ TypeScript type checking (strict)
- ✅ ESLint (max-warnings=0)
- ✅ **ALL tests with database**
- ✅ Production build
- ✅ Security audit
- ✅ Bundle size check
- ⏱️ Full validation (~5-10 minutes)

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### One-Time Setup
```bash
# Install the git hooks
npm run setup:hooks

# Or manually:
bash scripts/setup-hooks.sh
```

That's it! Now **every commit and push will be validated automatically**.

## 💻 How It Works

### 1. Pre-Commit Hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`)
Runs when you type `git commit`:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add feature"
# ↓
# 🔍 Running pre-commit checks...
# ✓ Type check
# ✓ Lint check
# ✅ All pre-commit checks PASSED!
```

**What it does:**
- Checks only **staged files**
- Runs TypeScript compiler
- Runs ESLint
- **Blocks commit if checks fail**

### 2. Pre-Push Hook (`.githooks/pre-push`)
Runs when you type `git push`:
```bash
git push origin feat/my-feature
# ↓
# 🚀 Running pre-push validation...
# ✓ Type check
# ✓ Lint (no warnings)
# ✓ All tests (running...)
# ✓ Build
# ✅ All pre-push checks PASSED! Safe to push.
```

**What it does:**
- Runs **full test suite**
- Runs **production build**
- **Blocks push if anything fails**
- Ensures code will pass CI

### 3. GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
Runs automatically on GitHub:
- Triggered on: push to main/develop, pull requests
- Runs in parallel with database
- **Strictly validates everything**
- **Blocks merging if fails**

### 4. Strict CI (`.github/workflows/strict-ci.yml`)
Additional comprehensive validation:
- 4 parallel jobs: Quality, Tests, Build, Security
- PostgreSQL database integration
- Security audit
- **All jobs must pass to merge**

## 🛡️ Protection Levels

| Level | When | Checks | Can Bypass? |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| **Pre-commit** | `git commit` | Type check, Lint | Yes (--no-verify) |
| **Pre-push** | `git push` | All tests, Build | Yes (--no-verify) |
| **GitHub CI** | On push/PR | Everything | **NO** |
| **Branch Protection** | PR merge | CI must pass | **NO** |

## ⚠️ Bypassing Checks (NOT RECOMMENDED)

### Skip pre-commit:
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "message"
```

### Skip pre-push:
```bash
git push --no-verify
```

**WARNING**: Even if you bypass local checks, **GitHub CI will still block the merge** if tests fail!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Hooks not running?
```bash
# Re-install hooks
bash scripts/setup-hooks.sh

# Verify installation
ls -la .git/hooks/pre-commit
ls -la .git/hooks/pre-push
```

### Hooks too slow?
```bash
# Skip pre-commit (still get pre-push validation)
git commit --no-verify -m "message"

# Then before pushing, manually run:
npm run test:run
```

### CI failing but local passes?
```bash
# Run the exact CI checks locally:
npm run type-check
npm run lint -- --max-warnings 0
npm run test:run
npm run build
```

## 📊 CI Status Badges

Add to your README.md:
```markdown

```

## 🎓 Best Practices

1. **Commit early, commit often** - Pre-commit is fast
2. **Test locally before pushing** - Pre-push catches issues
3. **Never bypass on main** - Always let CI validate
4. **Fix failing tests immediately** - Don't push broken code
5. **Keep tests fast** - Slow tests hurt productivity

## 🔐 What Happens on Failure?

### Local Hook Failure:
```
❌ Pre-commit checks FAILED!

Fix the issues above before committing.
To bypass (NOT RECOMMENDED): git commit --no-verify
```

### CI Failure:
- ❌ Red X on GitHub commit
- ❌ PR cannot be merged
- 📧 Email notification
- 🚫 **Blocks deployment**

## 🎯 Summary

**Before this system:**
- ❌ Could push broken code
- ❌ CI failures discovered too late
- ❌ Manual validation required

**With this system:**
- ✅ **Cannot commit** without type check + lint passing
- ✅ **Cannot push** without all tests passing
- ✅ **Cannot merge** without CI passing
- ✅ **Automatic validation** at every step

**Result: ZERO broken code reaches main branch! 🎉**
