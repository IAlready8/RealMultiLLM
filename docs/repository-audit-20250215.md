# Repository Audit — February 15, 2025

## Overview
- **Product**: Personal Multi-LLM management platform built on Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Prisma, NextAuth, Tailwind UI, and Vitest testing. The system aspires to deliver multi-provider chat, analytics, personas, pipelines, and secure key management. 
- **Current Focus**: Phase 2 backend service integration and quality improvements, with remaining automated tests unstable and several enterprise-grade systems partially stubbed or mocked.

## Architecture Snapshot
- **Frontend**: App Router pages under `app/*` deliver multi-chat, analytics, personas, pipelines, settings, observability, and admin areas with a polished glassmorphic design system and streaming UI support.
- **Backend**: Next.js route handlers provide APIs for LLM chat/streaming, analytics, provider configs, teams, goals, personas, observability, and key testing.
- **Domain Services**: `lib/*` and `services/*` host configuration, security, rate limiting, circuit breakers, analytics, export/import, and NDJSON streaming helpers.
- **Data**: Prisma schema models auth, provider configs, personas, goals, analytics, and collaboration entities. Datasource is set to PostgreSQL despite SQLite references elsewhere.
- **Testing**: Vitest suite (JS/TS) and pytest scaffolding for a Python `LLMManager`, though the corresponding core source folder is missing.

## Functional Strengths
1. **Rich multi-provider chat experience**: The multi-chat page orchestrates concurrent provider prompts, streaming updates, abort handling, persistent model settings, and comprehensive UI feedback. 
2. **Enterprise-ready API stack**: LLM chat route layers rate limiting, circuit breaking, security sanitization, observability metrics, error queuing, and analytics tracking before invoking the provider client.
3. **Secure provider configuration lifecycle**: API key services encrypt keys with AES-GCM, manage activation state, track usage, and expose CRUD API endpoints guarded by NextAuth sessions.
4. **Analytics scaffolding**: Analytics API aggregates Prisma data, caches responses, integrates a custom analytics engine, and exposes predictions/anomalies toggles; the UI provides charts, export, mock fallbacks, and time-range controls.
5. **Error and resilience infrastructure**: Centralized error taxonomy with UUID tracking, retryable metadata, async error processors, monitoring proxies on Prisma, request deduplication, circuit breaker utilities, and smart cache invalidators.

## Critical Gaps & Risks
1. **Automated tests currently unusable**: `npm run test:run` fails because Vitest is missing, indicating dependency installation or script wiring issues; status docs also note dozens of failing tests pre-migration.
2. **Python core integration incomplete**: Pytest suite references `src/core/llm_manager`, but only a `.keep` placeholder exists, leaving cross-runtime architecture unimplemented and tests impossible to satisfy.
3. **Provider coverage inconsistent**: UI claims support for OpenRouter, Llama, GitHub, Grok, etc., yet TypeScript back-end implementations only handle OpenAI/Claude/Google; missing handlers break promised multi-LLM parity.
4. **Database configuration drift**: Prisma schema targets PostgreSQL while README/status indicate SQLite usage for dev, causing migration friction and increasing onboarding risk.
5. **Mocked analytics undermine insights**: Analytics page relies on random mock data when API fails, and API still fabricates quality metrics/predictions, limiting production readiness without real telemetry pipelines.
6. **Observability & rate-limit dependencies**: Multiple utilities assume Redis or external stores but repository lacks deployment wiring or configuration docs beyond placeholders.

## Completion Roadmap
### Phase A — Stabilize Foundations
1. **Dependency reconciliation**: Ensure `npm ci` installs Vitest binary; audit package manager lockfile, run lint/test/type-check pipelines, and document prerequisites.
2. **Database alignment**: Decide on authoritative dev/prod database (SQLite vs PostgreSQL), update Prisma schema, migrations, and docs accordingly; provide seed scripts and pooling configuration.
3. **Python core decision**: Either commit the missing `src/core/llm_manager` implementation or remove pytest references; align architecture doc with chosen runtime strategy.
4. **Environment hardening**: Produce `.env.example` parity with runtime expectations (encryption seeds, analytics configs, Redis endpoints), plus secrets rotation guidance.
5. **Test stabilization**: Re-enable Vitest suite, address mocked dependencies, and reach near-100% pass rate; enforce CI gating on lint/type/test.

### Phase B — Feature Completion
1. **Provider parity**: Implement adapters for OpenRouter, Anthropic (if not complete), Google Vertex, Llama, GitHub Copilot, Grok, plus streaming support and configuration forms consistent with UI promises.
2. **Pipeline & persona workflows**: Audit pipeline/persona pages/services for end-to-end coverage, add server routes and database operations where missing, and create user journey tests.
3. **Analytics engine**: Replace mock metrics with real tracking (Prisma aggregations, background jobs, or event ingestion), finalize predictions/anomaly detection modules, and integrate dashboards with actual data.
4. **Observability stack**: Wire metrics, logging, and audit trails to persistent stores (e.g., OpenTelemetry, ELK, Prometheus), document deployment, and add health dashboards.
5. **Rate limiting & caching infra**: Back implementations with Redis or Durable objects; include provisioning scripts and monitoring of limiter states.

### Phase C — Enterprise Hardening
1. **Security & compliance**: Complete RBAC, audit logging, encryption key rotation, MFA toggles, and compliance export flows; add penetration/regression tests.
2. **Collaboration features**: Finalize team membership, shared conversation APIs, and UI flows; ensure access controls map to Prisma models.
3. **Billing & monetization**: Introduce subscription management, usage quotas, and entitlement enforcement integrated with provider costs.
4. **Scalability & performance**: Load-test LLM endpoints, validate circuit breaker thresholds, add autoscaling guidance, and optimize streaming concurrency.
5. **Documentation suite**: Ship production-grade docs: setup guide, runbook, architecture deep-dive, API reference, SLA/DR plans, and customer onboarding playbooks.

## Immediate Next Steps (0-2 Weeks)
1. Run dependency install, confirm lint/type/test pipelines, and capture baseline metrics.
2. Resolve Prisma datasource conflict and verify migrations on chosen database.
3. Implement or excise Python core components to restore pytest viability.
4. Audit provider coverage: map UI promises to actual server implementations and prioritize missing adapters.
5. Replace mock analytics with real query outputs or clearly mark the feature as beta until telemetry pipeline is ready.

## Measuring Done-ness
- **Functional**: All advertised providers available with streaming, analytics dashboards display real metrics, personas/pipelines fully interactive, and export/import round-trips succeed.
- **Quality**: CI green across lint/type/test; load tests meeting latency targets; comprehensive monitoring dashboards live.
- **Security**: Secrets encrypted, RBAC enforced, audit trails queryable, compliance docs published.
- **Operational**: Deployment scripts verified on target platforms (Netlify/containers), disaster recovery tested, support runbooks delivered.
