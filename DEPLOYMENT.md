## Vercel Deployment (Primary)

The RealMultiLLM platform is designed primarily for Vercel deployment and includes the optimized `vercel.json` configuration.

### Prerequisites
- Vercel account
- Git repository connected to Vercel
- Environment variables configured in Vercel dashboard

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://your-project-name.vercel.app"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-nextauth-secret"
JWT_SECRET="your-jwt-secret"

# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@host:5432/database?schema=public"

# API Keys (for LLM providers)
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key"
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY="your-google-ai-key"
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-openrouter-api-key"
GROK_API_KEY="your-grok-api-key"

# Security
ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY="your-64-character-hex-key"

# Application features
ENABLE_ANALYTICS="true"
ENABLE_TELEMETRY="true"
ENABLE_AUDIT_LOGGING="true"

# Performance & Caching
CACHE_ENABLED="true"
CACHE_TTL="3600"
CACHE_MAX_SIZE="10000"
COMPRESSION_ENABLED="true"
COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD="1024"

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS="900000"
RATE_LIMIT_MAX="100"

# Telemetry
TELEMETRY_SAMPLE_RATE="0.1"
TELEMETRY_FLUSH_INTERVAL="30000"
TELEMETRY_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE="100"

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL="info"
LOG_FORMAT="json"
BLOCK_SUSPICIOUS_IPS="true"
```

### Deployment Steps
1. Link your Git repository to your Vercel account
2. Import the project with framework preset as Next.js
3. Add the environment variables listed above
4. Build command: `npm run build`
5. Output directory: `.next`
6. Root directory: `/`

## Netlify Deployment (Backup)

Netlify can host the RealMultiLLM platform with a special configuration. The `netlify.toml` file is already configured in this repository.

### Prerequisites
- Netlify account
- Git repository connected to Netlify

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# Same as Vercel, but with appropriate URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL="https://your-site.netlify.app"
NODE_ENV="production"

# All the API keys and database URLs as needed
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@host:5432/database?schema=public"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
# ... all other environment variables
```

### Deployment Steps
1. Connect your Git repository to Netlify
2. Set the build command to `npm run build`
3. Set the publish directory to `.next`
4. Add environment variables in Netlify dashboard
5. Netlify will use the `netlify.toml` configuration from this repository

## GitHub Pages (Documentation)

GitHub Pages cannot host the full RealMultiLLM application with API routes, but this repository includes documentation for creating a static version.

### Static Version Limitations
- No API routes (serverless functions) available
- No server-side rendering for dynamic content
- Authentication and database features require external API

### Static Deployment
For demonstration purposes only, see `GITHUB_PAGES_DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed instructions.

## Self-Hosting Options

### Vercel CLI Deployment
A deployment script has been created for Vercel deployments. Check `scripts/deploy-vercel.sh` for the automated deployment process.

```bash
# Run the deployment script
bash scripts/deploy-vercel.sh
```

### Netlify CLI Deployment
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI globally
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Deploy to Netlify
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start the production server
npm start
```

### Node.js Server
```bash
# After building
npm run start
```

### Platform Options
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Google Cloud Run
- Azure App Service
- DigitalOcean App Platform
- Railway
- Heroku
- Fly.io

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- Regularly rotate API keys
- Set up monitoring for API key usage
- Enable 2FA on all accounts

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Analytics

All deployment platforms will have access to:
- Real-time logs
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking
- Security monitoring

The application includes built-in analytics, audit logging, and telemetry features that work across all platforms.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Environment Variables Missing**: Ensure all required environment variables are set
2. **Database Connection**: Verify database URL is correctly formatted
3. **API Key Issues**: Check that API keys have the necessary permissions
4. **Build Failures**: Ensure Node.js version is compatible (18+ recommended)

### Performance Tips
1. Use a CDN for static assets
2. Enable compression and caching
3. Optimize database queries
4. Monitor API usage and costs
