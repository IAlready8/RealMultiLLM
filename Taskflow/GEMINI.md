# GEMINI.md - TaskFlow Multi-Agent System

## 1. Project Overview

This repository contains the **TaskFlow Multi-Agent System**, a comprehensive task analysis and management tool built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It provides a rich interface for breaking down complex tasks, assessing risks, and visualizing workflows using a multi-agent architecture.

The core application logic is designed to be generated by a build script, `ABuildScript.md`, which sets up a complete React project with all necessary files and dependencies.

**Key Technologies:**
- **Framework:** React (via create-react-app)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (inferred from class names)
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit
- **AI:** OpenAI API (gpt-3.5-turbo)
- **Backend & Auth:** Supabase
- **Visualization:** D3.js and Recharts
- **Testing:** Jest and React Testing Library

**Core Features:**
- **Multi-Agent System:** Utilizes a series of specialized agents (Analysis, Decomposition, Risk Assessment, Visualization) to process user-defined tasks.
- **AI-Powered Analysis:** Leverages the OpenAI API for intelligent task breakdown, with a robust rule-based fallback system.
- **Task Visualization:** Generates interactive D3.js graphs to visualize task dependencies and workflow.
- **Risk Assessment:** Identifies potential risks based on task complexity, methodology, and other factors.
- **User Authentication:** Manages user accounts and sessions via Supabase.
- **Redux State Management:** Centralizes application state for tasks, UI, and authentication.

## 2. Building and Running

The project is intended to be built from scratch using the provided build script.

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js
- npm

**Installation and Running:**
1.  **Run the build script:** Execute the commands in `ABuildScript.md` to create the project directory (`taskflow-multiagent`) and all its source files.
    ```bash
    # Navigate to a suitable directory (e.g., ~/Desktop)
    cd ~/Desktop
    
    # Run the build script commands provided in ABuildScript.md
    # This will create a new directory called 'taskflow-build/taskflow-multiagent'
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd taskflow-build/taskflow-multiagent
    ```
3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```
    Edit `.env.local` to add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` and Supabase credentials.

4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 3. Testing

The project is set up with Jest and React Testing Library.

- **Run all tests:**
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

## 4. Development Conventions

- **Code Style:** The project uses a consistent, modern TypeScript and React style. While not explicitly defined, the generated code follows standard conventions.
- **Authentication:** Handled by the `SupabaseService`, which provides methods for sign-up, sign-in, and session management.
- **API Services:**
    - `AIService`: Manages interactions with the OpenAI API, including a retry mechanism.
    - `AgentOrchestrator`: The central service that coordinates the different AI agents.
- **Components:** Components are organized by feature (e.g., `TaskFlow`, `Visualization`).
- **State Management:** Redux is used for managing global state. Reducers for `tasks`, `ui`, and `auth` are defined in the `src/store/reducers` directory.
- **Security:** Basic input sanitization and validation are implemented in `src/utils/security.ts`.
