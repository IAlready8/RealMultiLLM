- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_URL` = `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`
- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (32+ character random string)
- [ ] `ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY` (64-character hex string)
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` (production database connection string)
- [ ] Provider API keys as needed

### 3. Build Process Verification
- [ ] Prisma client generation succeeds
- [ ] Database migrations run successfully
- [ ] Next.js build completes without errors
- [ ] All assets are properly included in the build

### 4. Preview Deployment
- [ ] Create a preview deployment from a pull request

- [ ] All LLM providers are accessible

### 2. Security Verification
- [ ] All API keys are properly encrypted
- [ ] Rate limiting functions as expected
- [ ] No security warnings or vulnerabilities
- [ ] Authentication tokens are secure
- [ ] Session management works correctly

### 3. Performance Verification
- [ ] Page load times are acceptable
- [ ] API response times are within expected ranges
- [ ] Serverless functions respond within timeout limits
- [ ] Streaming responses work correctly
- [ ] No performance degradation under load

### 4. Analytics and Monitoring
- [ ] Analytics are properly configured
- [ ] Error logging works correctly
- [ ] Performance monitoring is active
- [ ] Usage tracking functions properly

## Production Deployment

### 1. Final Checks
- [ ] Domain name is properly configured
- [ ] SSL certificate is active
- [ ] DNS settings are correct
- [ ] All environment variables are set for production
- [ ] Database migration has been run

### 2. Go Live
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Verify application is accessible
- [ ] Test all core functionality
- [ ] Confirm all providers work
- [ ] Verify user authentication

### 3. Post-Launch Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor application logs
- [ ] Watch for any errors or issues
- [ ] Verify that analytics are tracking properly
- [ ] Check usage patterns
- [ ] Monitor API key usage

## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues after deployment:

1. **Immediate Response**
   - Monitor error logs and performance metrics
   - Identify the critical issue
   - Assess the impact on users

2. **Rollback Process**
   - Go to Vercel dashboard
   - Navigate to Deployments
   - Find the last stable deployment
   - Click "Promote" to revert to that version

3. **Post-Rollback Actions**
   - Investigate the cause of the issue
   - Fix the issue in development
   - Test the fix thoroughly
   - Deploy the fix when ready

## Common Post-Deployment Issues

### 1. Database Issues
- **Problem**: Database connection failures
- **Solution**: Verify database URL and network access from Vercel

### 2. API Key Issues
- **Problem**: Provider API keys not working
- **Solution**: Verify environment variables and key permissions

### 3. Authentication Issues
- **Problem**: NextAuth not working
- **Solution**: Check NEXTAUTH_URL and NEXTAUTH_SECRET

### 4. Performance Issues
- **Problem**: Slow response times
- **Solution**: Check database queries and API provider response times

## Maintenance Schedule

### Daily
- [ ] Monitor application logs
- [ ] Check error rates
- [ ] Verify all providers are working

### Weekly
- [ ] Review API key usage
- [ ] Check performance metrics
- [ ] Update dependencies if needed

### Monthly
- [ ] Security review
- [ ] Database backup verification
- [ ] Performance optimization review
