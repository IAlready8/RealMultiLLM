2. **Technical Debt Management**: Allocate 20% of development time to refactoring and improving existing code
3. **Quality Assurance**: Maintain >95% test coverage for all new features
4. **User Feedback Integration**: Regular user testing sessions to ensure we're building what users actually want
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of platform performance to prevent degradation

## Success Definition
